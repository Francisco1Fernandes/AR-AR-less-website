        <h1>Dear detective</h1>
        <h6>It is me, Miguel Ramos, I am writing you to  tell you how the whole thing turned out.</h6>
        <h6>After some search we decided to arrest Marco.</h6>
        <h6>Like expected, he complained alot, saying things like "what would be my motive?" and "I have no reason to do this!".</h6>
        <h6> Looking back, I guess that's the one thing he lacked, clear motive.</h6>
        <h6>Unfortunatly another animal from the Park was found dead.</h6>
        <h6>We are now looking for who could have done it but needless to say, we won't be needing your "help" anymore. </h6>
        <h6>Thank your time</h6>
        <h1>From Miguel Ramos</h1>
