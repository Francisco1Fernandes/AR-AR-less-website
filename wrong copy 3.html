        <h1>Dear detective</h1>
        <h6>It is me, Miguel Ramos, I am writing you to  tell you how the whole thing turned out.</h6>
        <h6>After some search we decided to arrest the Mice.</h6>
        <h6>Like expected, they complained alot, saying things like "Is this about the stolen eggs, we promisse we'll find new ones!" and "We promisse the burger we ate off the floor didn't belong to anyone".</h6>
        <h6> Altough they were caught from stealing even more stuff, none of them felt like they were aware of the situation.</h6>
        <h6>Unfortunatly another animal from the Park was found dead.</h6>
        <h6>We are now looking for who could have done it but needless to say, we won't be needing your "help" anymore. </h6>
        <h6>Thank your time</h6>
        <h1>From Miguel Ramos</h1>
